We found that your app duplicates the content and functionality of apps currently available on the App Store. 

Apps that simply duplicate content and/or functionality create clutter, diminish the overall experience for the end user, and reduce the ability of developers to market their applications. This is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.

We recognize that there is a wide range in the quality of flashlight apps and that yours may be of better quality than many others out there. Or, it may include features or characteristics that distinguish it as more than just a flashlight app - or even something other than a flashlight app. But your app prominently features flashlight functionality, which classifies it as a flashlight app. And we simply have enough flashlight apps in the App Store.

We encourage you to review your app concept and evaluate whether you can incorporate different content and features that are in compliance with the Guidelines.

For app design information, check out the videos: "Getting Started video: The Ingredients of Great iPhone Apps" and "iPhone User Interface Design," available on the iOS Developer Center, and the iOS Human Interface Guidelines in particular, the sections, "Great iOS Apps Embrace the Platform and HI Design Principles" and "Human Interface Principles".

Alternatively, you may wish to consider building a web app using HTML5. HTML5 is the major new version of HTML and enables audio and video to play natively in the browser without requiring proprietary plug-ins. Using HTML5, web apps look and behave like native iPhone and iPad apps, and using HTML5's Offline Application Cache, your web apps work even when the device is offline. With web apps, you have flexibility to deliver as much or as little functionality as you desire. 

If you wish to build an HTML5 web app, you can do so and distribute it directly from your web site. It is not appropriate to submit an HTML5 web app to the App Store. 

To get started with iPhone or iPad web apps, please review Getting Started with iPhone Web Apps.
